Does your knee pain make it hard to climb stairs? Have you been struggling with joint pain for years? Then you may have arthritis.  Especially amongst the elderly, gait and balance disorders, like arthritis, cause falls which may be fatal. Early detection is key to remission.

Our system makes use of the kinect so that you can assess whether you might have a walking condition right from your home. We record skeletal data of a person walking and compare it to a database of classified human motion samples to find the most similar match. The system also provides other meaningful statistics that are important in diagnosing problems related to gait and balance. The results from our system should not replace a real diagnosis but they may be useful for a healthcare professional, especially as healthcare practices are improved by technology.
