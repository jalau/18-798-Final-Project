Does your knee pain make it hard to climb stairs and get up from chairs? Have you been struggling with joint pain for years? Then you may have arthritis! Arthritis doesn't only affect the elderly, but young people as well, it's an inflammation and swelling of the joints. Arthritis and other problems related to walking are best diagnosed and treated early. Especially amongst the elderly, gait and balance disorders cause falls which may be fatal. To examine this issue, we have developed an easy-to-use system to help determine whether a person might have a walking problem. 

Our system makes use of the kinect to record skeletal data of a person walking and compares it to a database of classified human motion samples to find the most similar match. The system also provides other meaningful statistics that are important in diagnosing problems with gait and balance. The results from our system should not replace a real diagnosis but they may be useful for a healthcare professional, especially as healthcare practices are improved by technology.
